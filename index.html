I am Neuroscience PhD student at the Univeristy of Southern California in the Neural Plasticity and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory. 

</b>

My research interests include understanding mechanisms of neural plasticity in individuals with and without neurological injury and enhancing neurorehabilitation techniques, both through the use of technologies such as virtual reality.
